 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
 
 the states parties to this convention,
 
 bearing in mind the broad objectives in the resolutions adopted by the sixth special session of the general assembly of the united nations on the establishment of a new international economic order, 
 
 considering that the development of international trade on the basis of equality and mutual benefit is an important element in promoting friendly relations among states, 
 
 being of the opinion that the adoption of uniform rules which govern contracts for the international sale of goods and take into account the different social, economic and legal systems would contribute to the removal of legal barriers in international trade and promote the development of international trade, 
 
 have decreed as follows: 
 
 part i sphere of application and general provisions
 
 part ii formation of the contract
 
 part iii sale of goods
 
 part iv final provisions

 article 1
 
 (1) this convention applies to contracts of sale of goods between parties whose places of business are in different states: 
 
 (a) when the states are contracting states; or 
 
 (b) when the rules of private international law lead to the application of the law of a contracting state. 
 
 (2) the fact that the parties have their places of business in different states is to be disregarded whenever this fact does not appear either from the contract or from any dealings between, or from information disclosed by, the parties at any time before or at the conclusion of the contract. 
 
 (3) neither the nationality of the parties nor the civil or commercial character of the parties or of the contract is to be taken into consideration in determining the application of this convention. 
 
 article 2

 article 4
 
 this convention governs only the formation of the contract of sale and the rights and obligations of the seller and the buyer arising from such a contract. in particular, except as otherwise expressly provided in this convention, it is not concerned with:

 (2) questions concerning matters governed by this convention which are not expressly settled in it are to be settled in conformity with the general principles on which it is based or, in the absence of such principles, in conformity with the law applicable by virtue of the rules of private international law. 
 
 article 8
 
 (1) for the purposes of this convention statements made by and other conduct of a party are to be interpreted according to his intent where the other party knew or could not have been unaware what that intent was. 
 
 (2) if the preceding paragraph is not applicable, statements made by and other conduct of a party are to be interpreted according to the understanding that a reasonable person of the same kind as the other party would have had in the same circumstances. 
 
 (3) in determining the intent of a party or the understanding a reasonable person would have had, due consideration is to be given to all relevant circumstances of the case including the negotiations, any practices which the parties have established between themselves, usages and any subsequent conduct of the parties. 
 
 article 9
 
 (1) the parties are bound by any usage to which they have agreed and by any practices which they have established between themselves. 
 
 (2) the parties are considered, unless otherwise agreed, to have impliedly made applicable to their contract or its formation a usage of which the parties knew or ought to have known and which in international trade is widely known to, and regularly observed by, parties to contracts of the type involved in the particular trade concerned. 
 
 article 10
 
 for the purposes of this convention: 
 
 (a) if a party has more than one place of business, the place of business is that which has the closest relationship to the contract and its performance, having regard to the circumstances known to or contemplated by the parties at any time before or at the conclusion of the contract; 
 
 (b) if a party does not have a place of business, reference is to be made to his habitual residence. 
 
 article 11
 
 a contract of sale need not be concluded in or evidenced by writing and is not subject to any other requirement as to form. it may be proved by any means, including witnesses. 
 
 article 12
 
 any provision of article 11, article 29 or part ii of this convention that allows a contract of sale or its modification or termination by agreement or any offer, acceptance or other indication of intention to be made in any form other than in writing does not apply where any party has his place of business in a contracting state which has made a declaration under article 96 of this convention. the parties may not derogate from or vary the effect or this article. 
 
 article 13
 
 for the purposes of this convention "writing" includes telegram and telex. 
 
 part ii formation of the contract 
 
 article 14
 
 (1) a proposal for concluding a contract addressed to one or more specific persons constitutes an offer if it is sufficiently definite and indicates the intention of the offeror to be bound in case of acceptance. a proposal is sufficiently definite if it indicates the goods and expressly or implicitly fixes or makes provision for determining the quantity and the price. 
 
 (2) a proposal other than one addressed to one or more specific persons is to be considered merely as an invitation to make offers, unless the contrary is clearly indicated by the person making the proposal. 
 
 article 15
 
 (1) an offer becomes effective when it reaches the offeree. 
 
 (2) an offer, even if it is irrevocable, may be withdrawn if the withdrawal reaches the offeree before or at the same time as the offer. 
 
 article 16
 
 (1) until a contract is concluded an offer may be revoked if the revocation reaches the offeree before he has dispatched an acceptance. 
 
 (2) however, an offer cannot be revoked: 
 
 (a) if it indicates, whether by stating a fixed time for acceptance or otherwise, that it is irrevocable; or 
 
 (b) if it was reasonable for the offeree to rely on the offer as being irrevocable and the offeree has acted in reliance on the offer. 
 
 article 17
 
 an offer, even if it is irrevocable, is terminated when a rejection reaches the offeror. 
 
 article 18
 
 (1) a statement made by or other conduct of the offeree indicating assent to an offer is an acceptance. silence or inactivity does not in itself amount to acceptance. 
 
 (2) an acceptance of an offer becomes effective at the moment the indication of assent reaches the offeror. an acceptance is not effective if the indication of assent does not reach the offeror within the time he has fixed or, if no time is fixed, within a reasonable time, due account being taken of the circumstances of the transaction, including the rapidity of the means of communication employed by the offeror. an oral offer must be accepted immediately unless the circumstances indicate otherwise. 
 
 (3) however, if, by virtue of the offer or as a result of practices which the parties have established between themselves or of usage, the offeree may indicate assent by performing an act, such as one relating to the dispatch of the goods or payment of the price, without notice to the offeror, the acceptance is effective at the moment the act is performed, provided that the act is performed within the period of time laid down in the preceding paragraph. 
 
 article 19
 
 (1) a reply to an offer which purports to be an acceptance but contains additions, limitations or other modifications is a rejection of the offer and constitutes a counter-offer. 
 
 (2) however, a reply to an offer which purports to be an acceptance but contains additional or different terms which do not materially alter the terms of the offer constitutes an acceptance, unless the offeror, without undue delay, objects orally to the discrepancy or dispatches a notice to that effect. if he does not so object, the terms of the contract are the terms of the offer with the modifications contained in the acceptance. 
 
 (3) additional or different terms relating, among other things, to the price, payment, quality and quantity of the goods, place and time of delivery, extent of one partys liability to the other or the settlement of disputes are considered to alter the terms of the offer materially. 
 
 article 20
 
 (1) a period of time for acceptance fixed by the offeror in a telegram or a letter begins to run from the moment the telegram is handed in for dispatch or from the date shown on the letter or, if no such date is shown, from the date shown on the envelope. a period of time for acceptance fixed by the offeror by telephone, telex or other means of instantaneous communication, begins to run from the moment that the offer reaches the offeree. 
 
 (2) official holidays or non-business days occurring during the period for acceptance are included in calculating the period. however, if a notice of acceptance cannot be delivered at the address of the offeror on the last day of the period because that day falls on an official holiday or a non-business day at the place of business of the offeror, the period is extended until the first business day which follows. 
 
 article 21
 
 (1) a late acceptance is nevertheless effective as an acceptance if without delay the offeror orally so informs the offeree or dispatches a notice to that effect. 
 
 (2) if a letter or other writing containing a late acceptance shows that it has been sent in such circumstances that if its transmission had been normal it would have reached the offeror in due time, the late acceptance is effective as an acceptance unless, without delay, the offeror orally informs the offeree that he considers his offer as having lapsed or dispatches a notice to that effect. 
 
 article 22
 
 an acceptance may be withdrawn if the withdrawal reaches the offeror before or at the same time as the acceptance would have become effective. 
 
 article 23
 
 a contract is concluded at the moment when an acceptance of an offer becomes effective in accordance with the provisions of this convention. 
 
 article 24
 
 for the purposes of this part of the convention, an offer, declaration of acceptance or any other indication of intention "reaches" the addressee when it is made orally to him or delivered by any other means to him personally, to his place of business or mailing address or, if he does not have a place of business or mailing address, to his habitual residence. 
 
 
 part iii sale of goods 
 
 chapter i general provisions
 
 article 25
 
 a breach of contract committed by one of the parties is fundamental if it results in such detriment to the other party as substantially to deprive him of what he is entitled to expect under the contract, unless the party in breach did not foresee and a reasonable person of the same kind in the same circumstances would not have foreseen such a result. 
 
 article 26
 
 a declaration of avoidance of the contract is effective only if made by notice to the other party. 
 
 article 27
 
 unless otherwise expressly provided in this part of the convention, if any notice, request or other communication is given or made by a party in accordance with this part and by means appropriate in the circumstances, a delay or error in the transmission of the communication or its failure to arrive does not deprive that party of the right to rely on the communication. 
 
 article 28
 
 if, in accordance with the provisions of this convention, one party is entitled to require performance of any obligation by the other party, a court is not bound to enter a judgement for specific performance unless the court would do so under its own law in respect of similar contracts of sale not governed by this convention. 
 
 article 29
 
 (1) a contract may be modified or terminated by the mere agreement of the parties. 
 
 (2) a contract in writing which contains a provision requiring any modification or termination by agreement to be in writing may not be otherwise modified or terminated by agreement. however, a party may be precluded by his conduct from asserting such a provision to the extent that the other party has relied on that conduct. 
 
 chapter ii obligations of the seller

 (c) possess the qualities of goods which the seller has held out to the buyer as a sample or model; 
 
 (d) are contained or packaged in the manner usual for such goods or, where there is no such manner, in a manner adequate to preserve and protect the goods.

 article 36
 
 (1) the seller is liable in accordance with the contract and this convention for any lack of conformity which exists at the time when the risk passes to the buyer, even though the lack of conformity becomes apparent only after that time. 
 
 (2) the seller is also liable for any lack of conformity which occurs after the time indicated in the preceding paragraph and which is due to a breach of any of his obligations, including a breach of any guarantee that for a period of time the goods will remain fit for their ordinary purpose or for some particular purpose or will retain specified qualities or characteristics.

 if the seller has delivered goods before the date for delivery, he may, up to that date, deliver any missing part or make up any deficiency in the quantity of the goods delivered, or deliver goods in replacement of any non-conforming goods delivered or remedy any lack of conformity in the goods delivered, provided that the exercise of this right does not cause the buyer unreasonable inconvenience or unreasonable expense. however, the buyer retains any right to claim damages as provided for in this convention.

 article 39
 
 (1) the buyer loses the right to rely on a lack of conformity of the goods if he does not give notice to the seller specifying the nature of the lack of conformity within a reasonable time after he has discovered it or ought to have discovered it. 
 
 (2) in any event, the buyer loses the right to rely on a lack of conformity of the goods if he does not give the seller notice thereof at the latest within a period of two years from the date on which the goods were actually handed over to the buyer, unless this time-limit is inconsistent with a contractual period of guarantee. 
 
 article 40
 
 the seller is not entitled to rely on the provisions of articles 38 and 39 if the lack of conformity relates to facts of which he knew or could not have been unaware and which he did not disclose to the buyer. 
 
 article 41

 article 42
 
 (1) the seller must deliver goods which are free from any right or claim of a third party based on industrial property or other intellectual property, of which at the time of the conclusion of the contract the seller knew or could not have been unaware, provided that the right or claim is based on industrial property or other intellectual property: 
 
 (a) under the law of the state where the goods will be resold or otherwise used, if it was contemplated by the parties at the time of the conclusion of the contract that the goods would be resold or otherwise used in that state; or

 article 44

 (2) unless the buyer has received notice from the seller that he will not perform within the period so fixed, the buyer may not, during that period, resort to any remedy for breach of contract. however, the buyer is not deprived thereby of any right he may have to claim damages for delay in performance. 
 
 article 48
 
 (1) subject to article 49, the seller may, even after the date for delivery, remedy at his own expense any failure to perform his obligations, if he can do so without unreasonable delay and without causing the buyer unreasonable inconvenience or uncertainty of reimbursement by the seller of expenses advanced by the buyer. however, the buyer retains any right to claim damages as provided for in this convention. 
 
 (2) if the seller requests the buyer to make known whether he will accept performance and the buyer does not comply with the request within a reasonable time, the seller may perform within the time indicated in his request. the buyer may not, during that period of time, resort to any remedy which is inconsistent with performance by the seller.

 article 50
 
 if the goods do not conform with the contract and whether or not the price has already been paid, the buyer may reduce the price in the same proportion as the value that the goods actually delivered had at the time of the delivery bears to the value that conforming goods would have had at that time. however, if the seller remedies any failure to perform his obligations in accordance with article 37 or article 48 or if the buyer refuses to accept performance by the seller in accordance with those articles, the buyer may not reduce the price. 
 
 article 51
 
 (1) if the seller delivers only a part of the goods or if only a part of the goods delivered is in conformity with the contract, articles 46 to 50 apply in respect of the part which is missing or which does not conform.

 (1) if the contract of sale involves carriage of the goods and the seller is not bound to hand them over at a particular place, the risk passes to the buyer when the goods are handed over to the first carrier for transmission to the buyer in accordance with the contract of sale. if the seller is bound to hand the goods over to a carrier at a particular place, the risk does not pass to the buyer until the goods are handed over to the carrier at that place. the fact that the seller is authorized to retain documents controlling the disposition of the goods does not affect the passage of the risk. 

 

 (2) nevertheless, the risk does not pass to the buyer until the goods are clearly identified to the contract, whether by markings on the goods, by shipping documents, by notice given to the buyer or otherwise. 

 

 article 68

 

 the risk in respect of goods sold in transit passes to the buyer from the time of the conclusion of the contract. however, if the circumstances so indicate, the risk is assumed by the buyer from the time the goods were handed over to the carrier who issued the documents embodying the contract of carriage. nevertheless, if at the time of the conclusion of the contract of sale the seller knew or ought to have known that the goods had been lost or damaged and did not disclose this to the buyer, the loss or damage is at the risk of the seller. 

 

 article 69

 

 (1) in cases not within articles 67 and 68, the risk passes to the buyer when he takes over the goods or, if he does not do so in due time, from the time when the goods are placed at his disposal and he commits a breach of contract by failing to take delivery. 

 

 (2) however, if the buyer is bound to take over the goods at a place other than a place of business of the seller, the risk passes when delivery is due and the buyer is aware of the fact that the goods are placed at his disposal at that place. 

 

 (3) if the contract relates to goods not then identified, the goods are considered not to be placed at the disposal of the buyer until they are clearly identified to the contract. 

 

 article 70

 

 if the seller has committed a fundamental breach of contract, articles 67, 68 and 69 do not impair the remedies available to the buyer on account of the breach. 

 

 chapter v 

 

 provisions common to the obligations of the seller and of the buyer

 

 section i. anticipatory breach and instalment contracts

 

 article 71

 

 (1) a party may suspend the performance of his obligations if, after the conclusion of the contract, it becomes apparent that the other party will not perform a substantial part of his obligations as a result of: 

 

 (a) a serious deficiency in his ability to perform or in his creditworthiness; or 

 

 (b) his conduct in preparing to perform or in performing the contract. 

 

 (2) if the seller has already dispatched the goods before the grounds described in the preceding paragraph become evident, he may prevent the handing over of the goods to the buyer even though the buyer holds a document which entitles him to obtain them. the present paragraph relates only to the rights in the goods as between the buyer and the seller. 

 

 (3) a party suspending performance, whether before or after dispatch of the goods, must immediately give notice of the suspension to the other party and must continue with performance if the other party provides adequate assurance of his performance. 

 

 article 72

 

 (1) if prior to the date for performance of the contract it is clear that one of the parties will commit a fundamental breach of contract, the other party may declare the contract avoided. 

 

 (2) if time allows, the party intending to declare the contract avoided must give reasonable notice to the other party in order to permit him to provide adequate assurance of his performance. 

 

 (3) the requirements of the preceding paragraph do not apply if the other party has declared that he will not perform his obligations. 

 

 article 73

 

 (1) in the case of a contract for delivery of goods by instalments, if the failure of one party to perform any of his obligations in respect of any instalment constitutes a fundamental breach of contract with respect to that instalment, the other party may declare the contract avoided with respect to that instalment. 

 

 (2) if one partys failure to perform any of his obligations in respect of any instalment gives the other party good grounds to conclude that a fundamental breach of contract will occur with respect to future instalments, he may declare the contract avoided for the future, provided that he does so within a reasonable time. 

 

 (3) a buyer who declares the contract avoided in respect of any delivery may, at the same time, declare it avoided in respect of deliveries already made or of future deliveries if, by reason of their interdependence, those deliveries could not be used for the purpose contemplated by the parties at the time of the conclusion of the contract. 

 

 section ii. damages

 

 article 74

 

 damages for breach of contract by one party consist of a sum equal to the loss, including loss of profit, suffered by the other party as a consequence of the breach. such damages may not exceed the loss which the party in breach foresaw or ought to have foreseen at the time of the conclusion of the contract, in the light of the facts and matters of which he then knew or ought to have known, as a possible consequence of the breach of contract. 

 

 article 75

 

 if the contract is avoided and if, in a reasonable manner and within a reasonable time after avoidance, the buyer has bought goods in replacement or the seller has resold the goods, the party claiming damages may recover the difference between the contract price and the price in the substitute transaction as well as any further damages recoverable under article 74. 

 

 article 76

 

 (1) if the contract is avoided and there is a current price for the goods, the party claiming damages may, if he has not made a purchase or resale under article 75, recover the difference between the price fixed by the contract and the current price at the time of avoidance as well as any further damages recoverable under article 74. if, however, the party claiming damages has avoided the contract after taking over the goods, the current price at the time of such taking over shall be applied instead of the current price at the time of avoidance. 

 

 (2) for the purposes of the preceding paragraph, the current price is the price prevailing at the place where delivery of the goods should have been made or, if there is no current price at that place, the price at such other place as serves as a reasonable substitute, making due allowance for differences in the cost of transporting the goods. 

 

 article 77

 

 a party who relies on a breach of contract must take such measures as are reasonable in the circumstances to mitigate the loss, including loss of profit, resulting from the breach. if he fails to take such measures, the party in breach may claim a reduction in the damages in the amount by which the loss should have been mitigated. 

 

 section iii. interest

 

 article 78

 

 if a party fails to pay the price or any other sum that is in arrears, the other party is entitled to interest on it, without prejudice to any claim for damages recoverable under article 74. 

 

 section iv. exemptions

 

 article 79

 

 (1) a party is not liable for a failure to perform any of his obligations if he proves that the failure was due to an impediment beyond his control and that he could not reasonably be expected to have taken the impediment into account at the time of the conclusion of the contract or to have avoided or overcome it or its consequences. 

 

 (2) if the partys failure is due to the failure by a third person whom he has engaged to perform the whole or a part of the contract, that party is exempt from liability only if: 

 

 (a) he is exempt under the preceding paragraph; and 

 

 (b) the person whom he has so engaged would be so exempt if the provisions of that paragraph were applied to him. 

 

 (3) the exemption provided by this article has effect for the period during which the impediment exists. 

 

 (4) the party who fails to perform must give notice to the other party of the impediment and its effect on his ability to perform. if the notice is not received by the other party within a reasonable time after the party who fails to perform knew or ought to have known of the impediment, he is liable for damages resulting from such non-receipt. 

 

 (5) nothing in this article prevents either party from exercising any right other than to claim damages under this convention. 

 

 article 80

 

 a party may not rely on a failure of the other party to perform, to the extent that such failure was caused by the first partys act or omission. 

 

 section v. effects of avoidance

 

 article 81

 

 (1) avoidance of the contract releases both parties from their obligations under it, subject to any damages which may be due. avoidance does not affect any provision of the contract for the settlement of disputes or any other provision of the contract governing the rights and obligations of the parties consequent upon the avoidance of the contract. 

 

 (2) a party who has performed the contract either wholly or in part may claim restitution from the other party of whatever the first party has supplied or paid under the contract. if both parties are bound to make restitution, they must do so concurrently. 

 

 article 82

 

 (1) the buyer loses the right to declare the contract avoided or to require the seller to deliver substitute goods if it is impossible for him to make restitution of the goods substantially in the condition in which he received them. 

 

 (2) the preceding paragraph does not apply: 

 

 (a) if the impossibility of making restitution of the goods or of making restitution of the goods substantially in the condition in which the buyer received them is not due to his act or omission; 

 

 (b) if the goods or part of the goods have perished or deteriorated as a result of the examination provided for in article 38; or 

 

 (c) if the goods or part of the goods have been sold in the normal course of business or have been consumed or transformed by the buyer in the course of normal use before he discovered or ought to have discovered the lack of conformity. 

 

 article 83

 

 a buyer who has lost the right to declare the contract avoided or to require the seller to deliver substitute goods in accordance with article 82 retains all other remedies under the contract and this convention. 

 

 article 84

 

 (1) if the seller is bound to refund the price, he must also pay interest on it, from the date on which the price was paid. 

 

 (2) the buyer must account to the seller for all benefits which he has derived from the goods or part of them: 

 

 (a) if he must make restitution of the goods or part of them; or 

 

 (b) if it is impossible for him to make restitution of all or part of the goods or to make restitution of all or part of the goods substantially in the condition in which he received them, but he has nevertheless declared the contract avoided or required the seller to deliver substitute goods. 

 

 section vi. preservation of the goods

 

 article 85

 

 if the buyer is in delay in taking delivery of the goods or, where payment of the price and delivery of the goods are to be made concurrently, if he fails to pay the price, and the seller is either in possession of the goods or otherwise able to control their disposition, the seller must take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances to preserve them. he is entitled to retain them until he has been reimbursed his reasonable expenses by the buyer. 

 

 article 86

 

 (1) if the buyer has received the goods and intends to exercise any right under the contract or this convention to reject them, he must take such steps to preserve them as are reasonable in the circumstances. he is entitled to retain them until he has been reimbursed his reasonable expenses by the seller. 

 

 (2) if goods dispatched to the buyer have been placed at his disposal at their destination and he exercises the right to reject them, he must take possession of them on behalf of the seller, provided that this can be done without payment of the price and without unreasonable inconvenience or unreasonable expense. this provision does not apply if the seller or a person authorized to take charge of the goods on his behalf is present at the destination. if the buyer takes possession of the goods under this paragraph, his rights and obligations are governed by the preceding paragraph. 

 

 article 87

 

 a party who is bound to take steps to preserve the goods may deposit them in a warehouse of a third person at the expense of the other party provided that the expense incurred is not unreasonable. 

 

 article 88

 

 (1) a party who is bound to preserve the goods in accordance with article 85 or 86 may sell them by any appropriate means if there has been an unreasonable delay by the other party in taking possession of the goods or in t, aking them back or in paying the price or the cost of preservation, provided that reasonable notice of the intention to sell has been given to the other party. 

 

 (2) if the goods are subject to rapid deterioration or their preservation would involve unreasonable expense, a party who is bound to preserve the goods in accordance with article 85 or 86 must take reasonable measures to sell them. to the extent possible he must give notice to the other party of his intention to sell. 

 

 (3) a party selling the goods has the right to retain out of the proceeds of sale an amount equal to the reasonable expenses of preserving the goods and of selling them. he must account to the other party for the balance.
